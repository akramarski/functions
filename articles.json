      "text1": "I don’t think physics and storytelling are that far apart. When you look at the universe in general, you always want an explanation of something because that’s how you understand it. But we need to grapple with things we can’t understand, that’s just part of human existence. In science you can never prove anything – you only prove that you can’t disprove it. It’s like you’re existing in the strangest place, where you must accept a certain level of openness. And you wouldn’t think that something like science would be so open to interpretation. I remember, when I was filming Oppenheimer, there was this scene where a lot of the background actors were real scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. And so, after I did my bit I would talk to them – one thing I asked about was this video with [the Nobel prize-winning physicist] Richard Feynman that you can find online, where he talks about how rubber bands work. And his whole point is, if you look at the world, it’s basically a ‘dynamic mess of jiggling things’. That’s a mission statement for what I believe – it’s incredible how physics can get you to a place where the solid seems insubstantial. So I asked one of the physicists on set, ‘Is it hard for you to look at the world and not see it for what it is, but to see it beyond what it is?’ And his answer was, ‘I actually think that’s the right way to look at the world, and the way you look at the world is not how it actually is.’ So what I accused him of he just spun right back around and accused me of. I thought that was great.”",

It doesn’t change just because somebody can look back to figure out how they got here. All that matters is you went along for the ride and understood your way forward.” Safdie is describing his early passion for physics, a subject he quit on a “coin toss” to study filmmaking at Boston University. “But looking back I’m like, ‘That’s a lot like how I approach narrative.’” With his brother, Josh, Benny’s freewheeling studies of the lowlifes and hustlers of his native New York (Uncut Gems, Good Time) have become bywords for cinematic cool, plugged into this era’s mood of free-floating anxiety. Next, he’s flying solo with The Smashing Machine, a mixed-martial arts drama starring The Rock. But it’s his performances in front of the camera that have been turning heads of late: as sleazy director-for-hire Dougie in The Curse, a cryptic black comedy he wrote with Nathan Fielder and starring Emma Stone, and as Edward Teller, father of the H-bomb, in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. The latter was a kismet moment for the actor, director and erstwhile physicist, who calls the role the fulfilment of a “childhood dream”.",

        "text1": "“How do we hold the present, the effects of conflict, when it’s so devastating? How can we hold it in a historical way without being overcome by it? Since MeToo and Black Lives Matter, there has been a refocusing of power – people who have never had it but who have worked all their lives have been given positions as the gatekeepers of culture for the first time and there was a lot of space gained. But now we’re seeing some of these people using their voice to take alternative positions – and being unceremoniously fired – at least in the States. All of that work undone. There are four books helping me to hold history in mind – Jacques Ellul’s Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes, Napoleon: A Life by Andrew Roberts, Iran: A Modern History by Abbas Amanat and Piers Brando’s The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s. When you look at these events in the context of 500 years, they look very different. Right now it feels like democracy, liberty, difference – liberal values – are at stake. We need to think about the fragility of these structures we’re taking for granted. I’m trying to figure out what is worth making that would engage and awaken our desire for freedom of speech and thought. Because you can’t find it without making it. You can’t just think it. As artists, we’re safest – we’re self-employed and we have more freedom to stand up for our ideologies. But even artists are being intimidated, retracting their statements. Finding a way to communicate is our job today – to be curious, not frightened, not consenting through silence. This is an invitation of sorts.”",
  
        "text2": "Curiosity is key to the Iranian-born American artist Tala Madani’s practice – she has an incisive eye and is unafraid to root around in the manifold discomforts of the human experience. For the past 20 years, her plasticky, poo-smeared paintings, scratchy drawings and blobby animated characters have poked at established notions of gender, childhood, motherhood, collective idealism and power structures. And despite the gut-wrenching reality of global events, that mission remains unchanged. This spring Madani’s work will feature in two shows: a solo survey at the National Museum of Contemporary Art EMST, Athens, as part of its What If Women Ruled the World? programme, and Hettie Judah’s major group exhibition Acts of Creation: On Art and Motherhood at the Arnolfini in Bristol.",

        "text1": "We’re into multigenerational stories, so LCD Soundsystem’s Losing My Edge is inspirational for us. There’s a big element in our series High on the Hog about passing the baton, and the song speaks to that idea. We love going to shows, we love dancing and we love an anthem – this song resonates with joy. We’ve seen LCD Soundsystem many times, including at a very sweaty show at the Fox Theater in Pomona, followed by us dancing together in the living room. The song feels like it’s been around forever but it doesn’t sound dated. “The lead singer, James Murphy, isn’t trying to be anything but what he is – he is honest and funny. The song talks about finding relevancy in our lives as we get older and continuing to be relevant in our society, which is poignant for us as female producers. It’s also a reminder not to fall for the trope of ‘those silly youths’. Everyone has a story to learn from – we want to stay aware of what’s happening but also bring all the experience and history with us to communicate ideas. With projects like High on the Hog we want to be connectors.”",
  
        "text2": "The LA-based producer and actor Karis Jagger first met the filmmaker Fabienne Toback at a pregnancy yoga class and a friendship blossomed as the pair ambled through the hills of Laurel Canyon together. Today they’re the force behind the award-winning Netflix series High on the Hog, hosted by the food writer Stephen Satterfield. Based on the culinary historian Jessica B Harris’s book of the same name, the show explores the present-day and little-told historical influence of African Americans on the kitchens and food cultures of the US, from the story of gumbo to the Black Panthers’ free breakfast programme for schoolchildren. Jagger and Toback continue to cook up projects under Hey Sistah, a production company and platform that unites their passions for sharing ideas, food experiences and cocktails.",
